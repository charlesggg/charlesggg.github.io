<p>Trying to learn from my mistake from previous games, I am playing conservatively in today game and I won handsomely. A few things I have tried. First of all, I tried not to change directions (unless it feels right). My feeling is that if you are thinking "let me change directions", then maybe you should not. The situation should call (or force you) for you to change naturally.
</p>
<p>Secondly, I also tried to play less aggressive. I didn't come to the net immediately when I see a short ball. I only come to the net when there is a short ball and I really push the other player deep and out of position. I used to come to net prematurely, and miss the next shot, although I am feeling I was having the upper hand in the rally. 
</p>
<p>I tried to find out when it is a good time to change directions.  I find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbvNpEAbfpE">this video</a> gives the best explanations with science.

<p>
It talks about "inside" or "outside". "Inside" means the ball doesn't cross your body. "Outside" means the ball cross your body from where it is coming from. On the Ad side, it is much easier to change directions from the "inside" (which is a forehand), the margin of error is much bigger. On the contrary, "outside" shot ( the backhand) gives tiny margin of error and should not attempt unless it is really necessary. 
</p>
<p>
The situation reverses on the Duals side. It is much safer to change direction on the backhand, it is much harder to hit it out than the forehand when trying to change directions.

<p>Let's try this out on the court!
