I am struggling with handling high short balls. It is supposed to be an easy winner but I normally hit it out. 
</p>
<p>I learnt a few tricks from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3aNSjuPxOE ">this video</a>. The most important thing is not run "into" the ball, you should be "move around" the ball, so it is a perfect distance for you to hit.
</p>
<p>The second tip is to prepare your racket. Sometimes I am approaching the ball but forget to turn completely. Don't run into the ball with the racket in front, it should be on your side and ready to hit. 
</p>
<p>
I also learnt not to commit too early. There are many good returners can return tough balls. Don't come to the net expecting to be a short ball, you should move a few steps in and be prepared. You should only commit when you actually see a short ball. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKAgDwtRR8I">The following video</a>explains why you need to "move around" the ball. The hand movement is a cycle. If it is a high ball, it is actually much further away from you than the normal hit zone.

<p>There are many tips from the first video which is worth mentioning. For example, using your left hand to measure the distance, take a little hop when hitting the ball. Please watch it to learn it. I will focus the 3 tips for now. 
</p>
<p>Next time, I am going to learn how to handle long high balls, which is another type of ball I am not good at handling. </p>
