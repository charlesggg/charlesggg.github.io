<p>We all know tennis is "game of errors". You are going to win by not hitting winners, you win by making less mistakes. Even for professional players, the winner to error ratio is more than four. 
</p>
<p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkhkcrFeZk">This video</a> reinforced the idea. It is hard to resist the urge to hit winners. We all try to win by "hitting hard" thus causing more errors. The most effective way of forcing errors is depth. All tennis players should focusing on more depth instead of more power. 
</p>

Another lesson I learned is where to target from the video. It seems very logical to target corners as we were told. The court is longer, thus it is much safer. It also gives the opponent a much bigger angle to hit the balls and forcing you to recover. It can also causing you to make unforced errors if you are targeting the corners. Instead, it is much safer to targeting the middle of the court, maybe just send the ball to the back hand next to the player.

<p>Lesson learnt!
