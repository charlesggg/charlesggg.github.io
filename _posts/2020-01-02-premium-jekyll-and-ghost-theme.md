<p>I am losing badly in UTR tennis matches. I was having good starts. I had good serve, the opponent had a bad return. I am aggressive on the ball, approaching the net and trying to finish the game. It didn't turn out well. Sometimes I hit out and lost the point, other times the opponent managed to get onto the ball and won the point. 
</p>
<p>I started to search for answers and find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYkhkcrFeZk">this video</a> is very helpful. I made the fundamental mistake of trying to change directions too early. It is very attempting to change directions when you see the open court on the other side, but it puts you in disadvantages if it is not a winner. The statistics has shown that it is four times more likely to make an error than hit a winner. That explains why I am losing the games although started it well.

<p>When hitting cross court, the net is lower, and court is longer. It is much easier to time, and you need to run less. More importantly, you are tempting your opponent to make errors.

<p>Just remember this image when you try to hit a winner
